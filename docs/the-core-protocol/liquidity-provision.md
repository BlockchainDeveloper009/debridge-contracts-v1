# Liquidity Provision

## **Provision of liquidity for cross-chain pools at Curve**

deBridge is a decentralized infrastructure that is fully composable with the existing DeFi ecosystem. Thatâ€™s why we donâ€™t need to do our own AMM or DEX, but just create different liquidity pools for deAssets in existing DEXes. In every blockchain supported by deBridge, there will be a liquidity pool for deUSDC at Curve or protocols that support the concept of the stable swap.

When the protocol is opened for the public and cross-chain swaps will be the first B2C application that will enable users to perform swaps from any asset on one chain to any asset on another.

To begin with, cross-chain swaps will be supported between the following chains: Arbitrum, Polygon, Ethereum.

Here are the instructions on how to deposit liquidity into the liquidity pool for each blockchain/L2.



### **Arbitrum deUSDC/2CRV pool**

This is a stablecoin pool at Curve that contains deUSDC (USDC bridged through deBridge) paired with 2CRV - Curve token that represents the basket of two stable coins (USDT+USDC)

In case you want to deposit $X amount of liquidity into this pool, please bridge half ($X/2) amount of USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum through deBridge at https://debridge.finance/. The other half should be bridged through Arbitrumâ€™s default bridge https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ in the form of USDT or USDC.

_Be aware that you will need to have some ETH on your wallet in Arbitrum in order to cover gas costs to broadcast the transaction._

Once you have deUSDC and USDC/USDT in your wallet balance on Arbitrum (you can check through https://arbiscan.io/), you can deposit the liquidity at Curve.

1. Go to the Curve website of the pool: https://arbitrum.curve.fi/factory/17/deposit&#x20;
2. Connect your wallet

### **Arbitrum deETH/ETH pool**

### **Polygon deUSDC/am3CRV pool**

This is a stablecoin pool at Curve that contains deUSDC (USDC bridged through deBridge) paired with am3CRV - Curve token that represents the basket of two stable coins (USDT+USDC+DAI)

In case youâ€™d like to deposit $X amount of liquidity into this pool, please bridge half ($X/2) amount of USDC from Ethereum to Polygon through deBridge at https://debridge.finance/. The other half should be bridged through Arbitrumâ€™s default bridge https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/ ) in the form of USDT or USDC or DAI.

_Be aware that you will need to have some Matic in your wallet on Polygon in order to cover gas costs to broadcast the transaction._

Once you have deUSDC and USDC/USDT/DAI in your wallet balance on Polygon (you can check through https://polygonscan.com/), you can deposit the liquidity at Curve.

1. Go to the Curve website of the pool: https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/111/deposit&#x20;
